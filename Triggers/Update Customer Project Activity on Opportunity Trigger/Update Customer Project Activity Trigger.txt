Create the object called “Customer Project” and create a Status field under this object with the picklist data type (Values=Active, Inactive). Create the relationship between this custom object and Opportunity so that the Customer Project is a related list to the Opportunity. Create  Active Customer project‑ field on Opportunity object (Data Type=Checkbox) The logic is when we create Customer Project for an Opportunity with the Status=Active, then Active Customer project check box on the Opportunity Detail page is automatically checked.
