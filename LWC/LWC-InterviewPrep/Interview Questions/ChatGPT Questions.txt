Probable Questions	
-> What is the difference between a Trigger and a Workflow in Salesforce?
	Workflow is automated process that fired an action based on Evaluation criteria and rule criteria.
	We can access a workflow across the object.Trigger is a piece of code that executes before or after a record is inserted or updated.
	
	Workflow
		You cannot create records
		They currently can only result in a task, email, field update, or outbound message
		We can not perform Dml operation in workflow
		We cannot query from database

	Trigger
		Can do these things, but obviously using code.
		Often needed for roll-up type scenarios where roll up summary fields cannot be used
		Often needed when a record needs to be created on a different object
		We can use 20 Dml operations in trigger
		Trigger can be used to invoke a webserive	
	
-> Describe the various types of sandboxes in Salesforce and their use cases.
	Developer Sandbox : Only Metadata is copied | Developement and Unit Tests
	Developer Pro Sandbox : Better version of Dev Sandbox with extra space | QA,Integration
	Partial Sandbox : Metadata with sample data | UAT
	Full Sandbox : Production copy | Staging and Performance Testing
	
-> Explain the difference between a Role and a Profile in Salesforce.
	Roles control record level access
	Profiles control Object level acces
	We can have users without roles
	We cannot have users without profiles
	Roles control what user can see
	Profiles control what user can do
		
-> What is the purpose of the "Master-Detail" relationship in Salesforce?
	In Salesforce, a "Master-Detail" relationship is a type of relationship between two objects where one object,
	known as the "master" or "parent," controls certain behaviors of the other object, known as the "detail" or "child." 
	Purpose and Features :
		Cascade Delete
		Roll-Up Summary Fields
		Security and Access
		Ownership and Control
		Required Fields on Detail Records

-> How can you schedule a job in Salesforce?
	String CRON = 'seconds,minutes,hours,days of month,month,days of week,year(optional)';
					'0,0,0,?,*,*
					'0,0-5,15'
					
	System.Schedule('msg',CRON,new ScheduleClass())
	Other way is via UI
	
	
	
-> What is the difference between SOQL and SOSL?
	SOQL is designed for querying Salesforce records to retrieve data. It allows you to query specific fields on a single object or related objects to fetch records based on specified conditions.
	SOSL is designed for searching across multiple objects simultaneously. It allows you to perform text searches across multiple objects and fields to find records that match a search query.
	Use SOQL when you know in which objects and fields you want to search and retrieve data. It is typically used for querying records within a single object 
	Use SOSL when you want to perform a full-text search across multiple objects to find records that match a given search term. 
		It's particularly useful when you don't know which fields or objects contain the data you are looking for.
		
-> Explain the purpose of a governor limit in Salesforce.
	Governor limits in Salesforce are restrictions imposed by the Salesforce platform to ensure fair usage and prevent misuse of shared resources.
	These limits are in place to guarantee the stability and performance of the multi-tenant environment that Salesforce provides.
	This also helps maintaining Codde Quality,Performance and stability,Multi-tenancy support.
	Governer limits are like:
		no. of SOQL in onr transaction : 100 Sync,200 async
		No of DML operations : 150
		No of records fetched in a transaction : 50,000
		CPU usage time limit :10 sec sync,60 sec async
		Email Limits
		
-> How can you handle bulk data processing in Salesforce?
	Data Import Wizards and Data Loader - to insert,update
	Apex Batch Processing to execute custom logics
	Queueable
	
-> Difference between data loader and Data Import Wizard ?
	Data import wizard can insert,update,upser records in bulk.Cannot export data,cannot delete,Cannot schedule data loads,insert upto 50000 records.Handle Duplication
	Data Loader can insert update,upsert,delete records in bulk,can export,can delete,can schedule,can insert 5 million records,,cannot handle duplication.

-> Difference between custom setting and custom metadata ?
	Custom setting is used to create custom data than can be associated with org,user
	Custom metadata types is also somewhat similar to custom settings but the records of custom metadata are metadata and not data.
	Custom Setting records cannot be deployed from one org to other
	Custom metadata types record can be deployed from one org to other.
	Custom setting cannot support relationship fields
	Custom metadata supports relationship fields.

Probabale Scenario based questions : 

	Scenario :: we have 2 users,A,B. B has read/write access on account object via profile. Same with user A. User A shared an account record with user B using manual sharing and gave only read access.
				Can user B edit that record??
	Answer :: No,since SF prefer the most restricted security and here most restricted is read only via manual sharing.
	
	Scenario :: User B has read access at object level and user A tries to give read/write via manual sharing,can B edit the records??
	Answer :: 	NO same reason as above.
	
	Scenario :: We have 2 record types X-Y,User B has access to only X. Can B access the records created using recordtype Y??
	Answer :: 	Yes,Record types doesnot restrict user from accessing any record. It does restrict from creating a record of that record type if record type is not accesible.
	
	Scenario :: We have 2 users U1 & U2 . U1 is up in hierarchy of U2. U1 has read permission of object and U2 has read/write.Can U1 edit the records owned by U2 since U1 is up in hierarchy??
	Answer :: 	No, U1 doesnot have object level access to edit. And Role hierarchy just allows the visibility.
	
	Scenario :: User A has access to User B data but User B cannot see User A data ? What can be the possible reason ??
	Answer ::  	OWD has to be private for the object ,
				i.then User A can be at higher position in role Hierarchy than User B and hence he can see user B data
				ii.If both are at same level in roles,then there may be a sharing rule based on criteria or owner which allows user A to see.
				iii.If no sharing rule,there can be a case where user B has manually shared the records with user A.
				iv.If even thats not the case, then there can be apex sharing which allows User A to access records. 
	
	Scenario :: User A has shared an account record with User B manually. Now if user A leaves the org or get deactivated what will happen? Can User B still access the record?
	Answer :: No, Once user get deactivated manual sharing ends. User B needs a re-share to work on that record again.
	
	Scenario :: We have a apex class mentioned with sharing and we have a nested apex class which has without sharing context, what will be the overall sharing??
	Answer :: child class does not inherit access from parent class. if parent is without,it will show all records without considering Sharing rules and if child class for the same is wwith sharing,it will cover Sharing rules.


	Scenario ::	You have done a deployment and user abc is not able to see the data,what would be the issue?
				cross questions : is this only user who is not able to see the data or user with same profiel were not able to see the data?
				Approach :	try to replicate the issue in lower environment like full-copy. If issue gets replicated,we might missed any access related to the profile or that user.
				if issue has not replicated then we might missed the access related things like permission set,sharing rules etc is changeset.
		
	Scenario ::	Can we upload null values from dataloader :
				dataloader has a checkbox which allows the null values,if it checked.otherwise we cannot upload the null values.
				
	Scenario ::	Is it okay to make changes in PROD 
				No,it is not ideal to make changes directly on production unless it is some postdeployment steps.We get only one prod cred to work with so it is not suggested either to do such changes.
				changes like creating custom label,custom settings can be done,but not related to apex,flows etc
				
	Scenario ::	When have you used @track decorator and @api decorator?
	
	Scenario ::	User is not able to see the field on page layout in prod,what can be the issue?
				First need to check the Field level security for that user, if yes then check page layout
				
	Scenario ::	What is async apex, tell me a scenario from your project where you used batch apex?
	
	Scenario ::	10 users have Create Read Edit permission on object, and later they need to remove create and edit permission for 2 users? what will be the approach?
				Create a profile with read permission and assign to all 10 users. using permission set assign the create and edit permission to 8 users.
				
	Scenario ::	Why we use Test.StartTest() and Test.Stoptest() ? Can we use it multiple times in a method?
	
	Scenario ::	There are 10 managed packages and they have a trigger on contact and each of these triggers is using 10 soql queries abd you written 5 SOQL queries using custom triggers.
				So will you get 101 SOQL error or not?
			- Managed package gets their own governer limit. So you will not hit SOQL 101 error due to mannaged package.
			
	Scenario ::	Create a batch apex and call a queueable apex from batch class
	
	Scenario ::	Can we call a future method from trigger. [explain using example]
	
	Scenario ::	How to a screen flow from LWC ? can we call a LWC from Screen flow ? How?
	
	Scenario ::	Write a SOL query to get accounts with no contacts [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contacts)]
	
	Scenario ::	Can we edit triggers,apex classes in Production ?
				No,we cannot!
				
	Scenario :: How to get current user id without using apex?
					can be imported directly or schema can be used.
					
	Scenario :: How to pass data from grand child component to grandparent?
				dispacthEvent with event bubbling : true or LMS
				
	Scenario :: We have a field in contacts. we have a trigger on contacts which checks if field value is <= 50.If yes,it will update to 100. We have a workflow rule which will update the field value
				to 50 if value is >= 100. What will be the end value once record is saved?
				- Answer based on order of execution.
				First before save trigger will run and changes the value to 100,then we have workflow rule which will turn the value to 50.This will fire the trigger again and value will change to 100.
	
	Scenario :: We have LWC component A, and AURA component B, both have a parent C. How will you pass data from A to B?
				We can do it in 2 ways. We can send data from A to C using custom event in LWC and we can send that data from C to B using parent to child communication in AURA
				Another way would be using LMS, we can create a messaging channel and publish event from A which can be subscribed at B.
	
	Scenario :: Consider you have a testsetup method where you created an account.You have two test methods, method A and Method B.Now you have changed the name of account record.
				What will you get in test method B? original name or Updated name?
			
			-	Original name as every test method has the data only in method.
			
	Scenario :: You have a condition where you need to make combination of namer,mobile and email field unique. how will you do it.
				- Creating a unique formula field using these 3 fields. [before insert trigger another option.]

ADMIN Questions 

	RELATIONSHIPS 
	
Question :	Can we convert a Lookup Relationship to Master Detail or vice versa ? how?

Question :	When we convert Master-detail relationship into lookup,we need to delete rollup summary if any.Is there any workaround to have the data also and convert it into look up as well?
			Data Backup need to be taken and similar functinoality need to be implemented with automation tools like flows or Triggers.
			
Question :	How can I achieve cascade delete in lookup relatinship?
			There is a field 'cascade delete'which on checked makes cascade delete true,but this field is not available for us to change.
			Account-Contact is the only relationship which is lookup and has cascade delete.
			Using a validation rule which enforces parent record to every child record and a trigger which will delete all child records on deletion of parent,we can have cascade delete in lookup

	USER MANAGEMENT
	
Question :	Why we cannot delete a user?
			User may have created records in the org eg opportunities,accounts etc All these records have the stamp/footprint of user as 'createdBy'. if we manage to delete the user
			It will be difficult to find the record owners. Hence,SF decided to preserve the user by just deactivating 

Question :	Can we re-activate a deactivated user? Will the previous license comes back with it?
			Yes, if licenses are available you can re-activate with same license.

Question : You have a new user in your team under same manager,How will you share the data to new user which is shared with other teammates?
			Putting user under the proper role hierarchy will do this.But is not in proper role hierarchy, we have to share the records using sharing rule or manual sahring.
			
Question :	Why we have Profile compulsory for a user but not the role ?
			Profile defines base level access for an object for a user whereas role does record level access but OWD is the base level access.so profile is compulsoryand roles are not.
	
	SHARING AND VISIBILITY
	
Question :	Role vs Profile
			Role - not compulsory ,Record level access with OWD,Sharing rule,apex sharing,manual sharing
			Profile - compulsory, Object level access [Permission set is field level] can also control other permissions as well
			Roles control record level access
			Profiles control Object level acces
			We can have users without roles
			We cannot have users without profiles
			Roles control what user can see
			Profiles control what user can do

	-> Different Levels of sharing
		
		1.Object Level Security : Access to the object.It allows you to perform actions like create,read,delete,update on object.
			-> Profiles : Profiles are provided to every user created in salesforce.It is manadatory to have profile for a user.One user can have only one profile.
						Profiles provides obj level access ,apex class access,system permissions,admin permissions etc.
						
			-> Permission Sets : Permission sets are used to give extra access to user or group of user above the profiles.Permission set can be used to give object level and field level access.
								one user may have multiple permission sets.You cannot remove access using permission set.
								
			Scenario :: Q.Consider there are 2 users with same profile,USER A USER B .User A can delete the record, user b cannot, What would be the case?
					==> User A has this extra access via permission set.
					
		2.Field Level Security : Access to the Fields on an object
			Profiles and Permission sets cover FIELD LEVEL SECURITY.
			
		3.Record Level Security : Access to records
			Covered by 
				OWD : Org wide defaults.OWD is basic level of access given to org user of object records.[public read,public read/write ,private].Most restricted is suggested.
				Role Hierarchy 
				Sharing Rules
				Manual Sharing
				Apex Sharing
	
	-> Implicit sharing : Access provided by default from SF, which cannot be controlled by us.
			2 types of implicit sharing : parent implicit sharing[If you have access to parent you should see child],child implicit sharing[if you have access to child you should see parent]
			
	-> Difference between Queue and Public group
		Queue used for ownership purpose.[Queue used in case assignment rule]
		Public group is used for access sharing purpose.[Permission set]
		Public group can have nested public group.
		Queue cannot have nested queue.
	
	-> Data Skew 
		When an object has multiple child records,it reduces the SF org performance,this is data skew
	-> Ownerhip Skew
		When User owns huge number of records then it is Ownership skew.To avoid it, avoid assigning default owner to any record.
	
	** WHENEVER THERE IS CONFLICT BETWEEN RECORD LEVEL ACCESS AND OBJECT LEVEL ACCESS SF PREFERS THE MOST RESTRICTED ONE.

DEVELOPER QUESTIONS

	What is SLOT in LWC?
	When to use Iterable and when to use querylocator
				
LWC [LMS,Parent child]
	code for conditional rendering a list and map [https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/297834/iterate-a-javascript-map-in-lightning-web-component-template]
	why LWC over AURA
	when to use LWC when to use AURA
	Decorators
	Lifecycle hooks [when to use which hook]
	Parent to Child[types of data can be passed (primitive/non-primitive),decorator] 
	Child to Parent[custom event,kebabcase,lowercase,custom event parameters]
	LMS syntax meta file,publish,subscribe,msg channel
	Lightning Data Services [Wire [ui/recordApi ,getRecord], record form,record edit form,view form]
	why we have import statements : LWC is build on top of HTML elementwe need to implement the lightningElement,
		LWC is built on HTML and on top of that we have SF specific functionalities like LDS,the security etc in the lightningElement hence we import LightingElement
	And we extend it so that we can leverage LWC features like lifecycle hooks.
	We export the class to be used by others
	LWC-Apex Interaction [wire(immutable data.if want to mutate create shallow copy),imperative data]
	lightning component bundle [html,css,js,meta.xml]
	Can we put multiple decorators in one property.[execution engine will not decide which one to use first as all decorators have their own features]
	Can we change the value of a property in child component which was passed by parent component.[@api property can be changed in child or not??]
		- NO we get the values from parent to child in read-only format.[only way is to clone the property and change the value]
	Can we put wire inside a method?? - No [decorators should be used inside the class and not inside the method]
	When does wire property gets value ?? 
		first runs constructor -> then wire runs and get default value ->
			execution engine runs and if default values not available it assigns undefined -> when values are avaliable it loads value to wire -> connected callback
	Difference between Event.StopPropogation vs Event.PreventDefault ??
		Event.PreventDefault :: Stops the default behaviour of form
		Event.StopPropogation :: stops propogating nested events [if we have events on div inside div inside div and the innermost div gets clicked but you dont want other div's event to be fired then use StopPropogation]
		CALLBACK FUNCTION :: if a fuinction is input parameter for another function [Callback functions are not sync or async. Behaviour depends on the function in which we are calling the function]
	Promise and PromiseAll ::
	SHADOW DOM :: Inner DOM within a DOM 
	Can we use LWC in Flows - In screen flow yes,in RTF no
	
Trigger scenarios [Order of execution]
	- prevent contact duplicates based on email,
	- custom rollup summary,
	- max-min amount of opportunity on account,
	- Creation of task on creation of opportunity and send email when task is not completed on due date,
	- Account should have only one primary contact [selected from linked contacts using a custom checkbox] if one selected other should get un-selected.

Why should we hire you [what values you bring to org ] 
	Flexible with the learnings and open to work on new technologies.
	Worked on multiple clouds and done respected certifications
	even in previous orgs took up the work as challenge when I was being asked to work and deliver
