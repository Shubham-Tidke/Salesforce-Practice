Deloitte USI

Q.1 Write a Query to get all contacts related to an account 
	ANS : Select Id,Name ,(Select Id from Contacts) from account]
	
	Q.1.1 : What will be the query if we have any custom object instead of contacts (custom_object__r)

Q.2 What kind of relationship does account and contact has ?

Q.3  Consider there are 2 users with same profile,USER A USER B .User A has access to a record, user b has no access to the same, What would be the case?[Manual sharing,sharing rule etc]

Q.4 We have a checkbox field on contact.If the field is checked record should be read-only . How to achieve it?
	ANS : Record type ,Validation Rules,Trigger

Q.5 We have a junction object record for object A,object B. What will happen to the junction object record if we delete record A.

Q.6 Write a trigger to get count of contacts on Account object.

	trigger contactTrigger on Contact(after insert,after update,after delete,after undelete){
		
	}
	public class ContactHandler {
		set<Id>accs = new Set<Id>();
		List<Account>accList = new List<Account>();
		public static updateCount(List<Contact>conList){
			for(Contact c : conList){
				if(c.AccountId != null){
					accs.add(c.AccountId);
				}
			}
			for(Account a :[Select Id (Select Id From Contacts) From Account WHERE Id  IN : accs]){
				a.countOfContacts__c = a.Contacts.size();
				accList.add(a);
			}
			try{
				Database.saveResult[] result = database.Update(accList);
				for(Database.saveResult sr : result){
					if(!sr.isSuccess()){
						for(Database.Error er : sr.getErrors()){
							system.debug(er);
						}
					}
				}
			}
			catch(Exception e){
				system.debug(e);
			}
		}
	}
	
Q.7 Difference between '==' and '==='

	JS question
	123 == '123'
	123 === '123'

Q.8 X = false, Y = '0', Z = 0  (x==y ??) (x==z ??)

Q.9 arr = [1,2,3,4,5] arr.filter(x => x >= 3) ??

Q.10 Can we call a batch apex inside a batch

Q.11 How to get the failed record ids from the batch apex. (Database.Stateful)
	AsyncApexjob iD = [SELECT id,no of errors from asysncApex where  id:Bc.getJobId()]

Q.12 We have a Lightning input with 'required' tag. what will happen if we dont submit without giving input to that field?

Q.13 We have lightning record edit form on a object which shows 10 fields. if user has access to 5 field what will user sees on form ? [Does LDS supports sharing rule and FLS ?]

Q.14. When we use test.isRunning



WIPRO

01. Automation tools in salesforce
02. scenario where you used the flows,approval process
03. can you delete a user is salesforce
04. difference is freezing and deactivating the user
05. what are the licences ? which licence will be their for admin
06. explain the sales process in salescloud
07. If a lead is assigned to a user and user didn't respond to the lead how will you work with that lead [auto response rule,escalation rule]
08. Lead conversions
09. Explain a scenario where you faced issues in LWC and you worked and implementd it successfully.
10. decorators in LWC
11. Lightning data services in LWC [getRecord,getRecords ,Lightning forms,wire]
12. Component communication in LWC [parent to child , child to parent , LMS]
13. Trigger to prevent editing of an account record if it was created 7 days ago

trigger accountTrigger on Account(before update){
	if(trigger.isUpdate && trigger.isBefore){
		accountTriggerHandler.preventDelete(trigger.new);
	}
}
public class accountTriggerHandler{
	public void preventDelete(List<Account>accList){
		for(Account acc : accList){
			if((acc.CreatedDate - System.Today())  > 7){
				acc.Name.addError('Cannot edit this record!');
			}
		}
	}
}

Questions to ask : what kinds of projects in the pipeline,how project allocation works,What are the expectations from this role in project persoective,kinds of cloud,how delivery works
ADMIN Questions [Security related, profiles,permission set,sharing rule,manual sharing,OWD,Record type,validation rule,flows]

Role vs Profile
	Role - not compulsory ,Record level access with OWD,Sharing rule,apex sharing,manual sharing
	Profile - compulsory, Object level access [Permission set is field level] can also control other permissions as well
Platform Events,CDC
Flows interview questions
GOVERNER LIMITS
Async Apex
	batch in batch
	calling future in batch
	
LWC [LMS,Parent child]
	code for conditional rendering a list and map [https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/297834/iterate-a-javascript-map-in-lightning-web-component-template]
	why LWC over AURA
	when to use LWC when to use AURA
	Decorators
	Lifecycle hooks [when to use which hook]
	Parent to Child[types of data can be passed (primitive/non-primitive),decorator] 
	Child to Parent[custom event,kebabcase,lowercase,custom event parameters]
	LMS syntax meta file,publish,subscribe,msg channel
	Lightning Data Services [Wire [ui/recordApi ,getRecord], record form,record edit form,view form]
	why we have import statements : LWC is build on top of HTML elementwe need to implement the lightningElement,
		LWC is built on HTML and on top of that we have SF specific functionalities like LDS,the security etc in the lightningElement hence we import LightingElement
	And we extend it so that we can leverage LWC features like lifecycle hooks.
	We export the class to be used by others
	LWC-Apex Interaction [wire(immutable data.if want to mutate create shallow copy),imperative data]
	lightning component bundle [html,css,js,meta.xml]
	Can we put multiple decorators in one property.[execution engine will not decide which one to use first as all decorators have their own features]
	Can we change the value of a property in child component which was passed by parent component.[@api property can be changed in child or not??]
		- NO we get the values from parent to child in read-only format.[only way is to clone the property and change the value]
	Can we put wire inside a method?? - No [decorators should be used inside the class and not inside the method]
	When does wire property gets value ?? 
		first runs constructor -> then wire runs and get default value ->
			execution engine runs and if default values not available it assigns undefined -> when values are avaliable it loads value to wire -> connected callback
	Difference between Event.StopPropogation vs Event.PreventDefault ??
		Event.PreventDefault :: Stops the default behaviour of form
		Event.StopPropogation :: stops propogating nested events [if we have events on div inside div inside div and the innermost div gets clicked but you dont want other div's event to be fired then use StopPropogation]
		CALLBACK FUNCTION :: if a fuinction is input parameter for another function [Callback functions are not sync or async. Behaviour depends on the function in which we are calling the function]
	Promise and PromiseAll ::
	SHADOW DOM :: Inner DOM within a DOM 
	Can we use LWC in Flows - In screen flow yes,in RTF no
	
Trigger scenarios [Order of execution]
	- prevent contact duplicates based on email,
	- custom rollup summary,
	- max-min amount of opportunity on account,
	- Creation of task on creation of opportunity and send email when task is not completed on due date,
	- Account should have only one primary contact [selected from linked contacts using a custom checkbox] if one selected other should get un-selected.

Why should we hire you [what values you bring to org ] 
	Flexible with the learnings and open to work on new technologies.
	Worked on multiple clouds and done respected certifications
	even in previous orgs took up the work as challenge when I was being asked to work and deliver
