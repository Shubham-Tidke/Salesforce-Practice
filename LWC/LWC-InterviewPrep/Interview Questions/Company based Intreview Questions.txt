WIPRO MANAGERIAL ROUND 

1. Tell me about your day-to-day role and activities you perform in your project ?

	"In my day-to-day role as a Salesforce developer, I play a crucial role in designing, implementing, and maintaining Salesforce solutions to meet our organization's business needs. 
	A typical day involves a combination of coding, problem-solving, and collaboration with various stakeholders.
	One of my primary responsibilities is to analyze and understand the business requirements provided by different departments.
	This involves regular communication with end-users and business analysts to gather insights into their processes and challenges. Once the requirements are clear,
	I translate them into technical specifications and design solutions that align with best practices and Salesforce platform capabilities.
	
2. Everyone is capable of what you can do, developement and deployment. What key values you have different from others which can get business to the organization?
	Eeven if everyone is doing the same thing,everyone has different process and way of approach the solution.
	my experience in sales and customer relationship management allows me to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business objectives.
	I understand that the ultimate goal of any Salesforce implementation is to enhance the customer experience, streamline operations, and drive revenue. 
	I bring a customer-centric approach to my work, ensuring that the solutions I implement not only meet technical requirements but also contribute to the overall success of the business.

3. What are your views on learning new skills and technology ? will you work on new skills which you had no exposure earlier?
	I believe in the continuous pursuit of learning and adapting to new skills and technologies. 
	In today's dynamic work environment, staying on top of emerging trends is crucial for personal and professional growth. 
	I am always open to acquiring new skills, even those I may not have been exposed to before.
	I see it as an opportunity to broaden my expertise, enhance my problem-solving capabilities, and contribute more effectively to the goals of the team and the organization

4. Sometimes while working for projects you have to stretch your workhours.Are you okay with that?
	"I understand that sometimes projects require additional time and effort to meet deadlines, and I am fully committed to ensuring the success of any project I'm involved in.
	I have a strong work ethic and am willing to put in extra hours when necessary to deliver high-quality results. 
	However, I also believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance to sustain long-term productivity and creativity. 
	I am open to occasional overtime when it's crucial for the project, but I also value efficiency and effective time management to minimize the need for consistent long work hours. 
	I believe in being proactive and planning ahead to mitigate the need for last-minute rushes.
	Overall, I am flexible and adaptable to the needs of the team and the project, but I also recognize the importance of maintaining a sustainable and balanced approach to work."

5. Have you worked on any client facing projects? How did you work with them?
	Yes, I have had the opportunity to work on several client-facing projects throughout my career. In my previous role at [Previous Company], 
	I was actively involved in projects that required direct interaction with clients. My primary responsibility was to understand their requirements, expectations, and goals. 
	To ensure a successful collaboration, I established clear lines of communication from the outset.
	I initiated regular meetings to provide project updates, discuss progress, and address any concerns or feedback they might have had. 
	I believe that proactive communication is crucial in client-facing projects, as it helps in building a strong relationship based on trust and transparency
	
6. tell me one of the add-ons you did in your projects which added values to the organization
7. Do you have any experience in leading the team?
8. Have you worked with multiple vendors?
9. why do you think we should have you?

	"I believe I bring a combination of skills, experience, and a strong commitment to contributing to the success of your organization.
	My background in [mention relevant experience or industry] has equipped me with the necessary expertise to tackle the challenges in this role effectively. 
	Additionally, my [specific skills, such as problem-solving, communication, or leadership] have consistently allowed me to deliver results and drive positive outcomes in my previous positions.
	What sets me apart is not just my technical proficiency but also my ability to adapt to new situations quickly and collaborate seamlessly with diverse teams.

- Tell me about your roles and responsibilites
- Scenario 1 : we have 2 cutom object shipment and shipping address with parent to child relationship,we can have multiple shipping addresses.
	We want to restric user from adding not more than 3 shipping address without writing any custom code. How to do it.
	How will we deal with existing data records which has already more than 3 shipping addresses .How will you process those?
	
- Scenario 2 :We have an existing system in salesforce and we have a flow and process builder implemented on an object which gets executed on creation/updation.
	In Production you see 101 soql error,how will you approach the solution and how will you resolve it?
		expected : check debug logs to check the whole transaction[replicating issue in fullcopy].Check if there is any code which has DML in loop.Check if resursion is happening,if yes : https://www.apexhours.com/how-to-avoid-recursion-in-trigger/
	
- Scenario 3 : Write trigger to get the total sum of opportunities and maximum opportunity on account.

Persistent Systems [Cleared]

-	SOQL LIMIT for sync and async
	- 100 for Sync 200 for async
	
-	how many records in one SOQL
	- 50000 records in one SOQL and one transaction.
	
-	Apex best practices
	- Code Bulkification [No SOQL queries in loops,DML operations on list of sObjects,Null checks]
	- Using try catch for error handling
	- Using Database class for DML operations.
	
-	LWC BEST PRACTICES
	- Use UI API wire Adaptors whenever possible [getRecord,createRecord,getPicklistValues,deleteRecord]
	- use @wire decoraator to fetch immutable data
	- avoid static references [use custom settings/custom labels instead]
	- Using conditional rendering which can improve performance by minimizing DOM updates.
	- minimizing use of global variables
	- error handling using try-catch.
	
-	With Sharing without sharing
	- With Sharing enforce Sharing rules [record level access] by default apex class runs in system context.
	
- 	with security enforced
	- Enforces Field level security on SOQL query. If user queries and doesnot have access to field,he will not be able to get the records.
	
-	can we call future in trigger?
	- Yes, possible.Used to avoid Mixed DML error.working with setup object(User) and non-setup object(Account,contact)
	
-	batch in trigger?
	- You can call a batch from a trigger, but you need to be aware of potential limits you could hit. You can only have 5 batch jobs queued or executing at once.
		If your trigger calls batch jobs each time, then you could quickly exceed that limit and have CPU timeout error.
		
-	heap size?
	- 6MB Synchronuos 12MB AsyncApexjob
	
-	Write LWC and apex to fetch account and its related contact details when account name is provided from UI
<template>
	<lightning-input type = text required placeholder = 'enter account name here' onchange={AccountDetailsHandler}> </lightning-input>
	<lightning-button label="get account details" onSubmit = {getAccountDetailsHandler}></lightning-button>
