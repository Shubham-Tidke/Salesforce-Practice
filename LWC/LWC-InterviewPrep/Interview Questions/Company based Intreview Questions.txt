	I believe in being proactive and planning ahead to mitigate the need for last-minute rushes.
	Overall, I am flexible and adaptable to the needs of the team and the project, but I also recognize the importance of maintaining a sustainable and balanced approach to work."

5. Have you worked on any client facing projects? How did you work with them?
	Yes, I have had the opportunity to work on several client-facing projects throughout my career. In my previous role at [Previous Company], 
	I was actively involved in projects that required direct interaction with clients. My primary responsibility was to understand their requirements, expectations, and goals. 
	To ensure a successful collaboration, I established clear lines of communication from the outset.
	I initiated regular meetings to provide project updates, discuss progress, and address any concerns or feedback they might have had.

Deloitte USI techno MANAGERIAL

- Tell me about your roles and responsibilites
- Scenario 1 : we have 2 cutom object shipment and shipping address with parent to child relationship,we can have multiple shipping addresses.
	We want to restric user from adding not more than 3 shipping address without writing any custom code. How to do it.
	How will we deal with existing data records which has already more than 3 shipping addresses .How will you process those?
	
- Scenario 2 :We have an existing system in salesforce and we have a flow and process builder implemented on an object which gets executed on creation/updation.
	In Production you see 101 soql error,how will you approach the solution and how will you resolve it?
	
- Scenario 3 : Write trigger to get the total sum of opportunities and maximum opportunity on account.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probabale Scenario based questions : You have done a deployment and user abc is not able to see the data,what would be the issue?
- cross questions : is this only user who is not able to see the data or user with same profiel were not able to see the data?
	Approach : try to replicate the issue in lower environment like full-copy. If issue gets replicated,we might missed any access related to the profile or that user.
			if issue has not replicated then we might missed the access related things like permission set,sharing rules etc is changeset.
- Can we upload null values from dataloader :
	dataloader has a checkbox which allows the null values,if it checked.otherwise we cannot upload the null values.
- Is it okay to make changes in PROD 
	No,it is not ideal to make changes directly on production unless it is some postdeployment steps.We get only one prod cred to work with so it is not suggested either to do such changes.
	changes like  creating custom label,custom settings can be done,but not related to apex,flows etc
- When have you used @track decorator and @api decorator?
- User is not able to see the field on page layout in prod,what can be the issue?
	First need to check the Field level security for that user, if yes then check page layout
- What is async apex, tell me a scenario from your project where you used batch apex?[]

ADMIN Questions [Security related, profiles,permission set,sharing rule,manual sharing,OWD,Record type,validation rule,flows]

Role vs Profile
	Role - not compulsory ,Record level access with OWD,Sharing rule,apex sharing,manual sharing
	Profile - compulsory, Object level access [Permission set is field level] can also control other permissions as well
	Roles control record level access
	Profiles control Object level acces
	We can have users without roles
	We cannot have users without profiles
	Roles control what user can see
	Profiles control what user can do

Sharing and Visibility
	-> Different Levels of sharing
		
		1.Object Level Security : Access to the object.It allows you to perform actions like create,read,delete,update on object.
			-> Profiles : Profiles are provided to every user created in salesforce.It is manadatory to have profile for a user.One user can have only one profile.
						Profiles provides obj level access ,apex class access,system permissions,admin permissions etc.
						
			-> Permission Sets : Permission sets are used to give extra access to user or group of user above the profiles.Permission set can be used to give object level and field level access.
								one user may have multiple permission sets.You cannot remove access using permission set.
								
			Scenario :: Q.Consider there are 2 users with same profile,USER A USER B .User A can delete the record, user b cannot, What would be the case?
					==> User A has this extra access via permission set.
					
		2.Field Level Security : Access to the Fields on an object
			Profiles and Permission sets cover FIELD LEVEL SECURITY.
			
		3.Record Level Security : Access to records
			Covered by 
				OWD : Org wide defaults.OWD is basic level of access given to org user of object records.[public read,public read/write ,private].Most restricted is suggested.
				Role Hierarchy 
				Sharing Rules
				Manual Sharing
				Apex Sharing
	
	-> Implicit sharing : Access provided by default from SF, which cannot be controlled by us.
			2 types of implicit sharing : parent implicit sharing[If you have access to parent you should see child],child implicit sharing[if you have access to child you should see parent]
			
	-> Difference between Queue and Public group
		Queue used for ownership purpose.[Queue used in case assignment rule]
		Public group is used for access sharing purpose.[Permission set]
		Public group can have nested public group.
		Queue cannot have nested queue.
	
	-> Data Skew 
		When an object has multiple child records,it reduces the SF org performance,this is data skew
	-> Ownerhip Skew
		When User owns huge number of records then it is Ownership skew.To avoid it, avoid assigning default owner to any record.
	
	** WHENEVER THERE IS CONFLICT BETWEEN RECORD LEVEL ACCESS AND OBJECT LEVEL ACCESS SF PREFERS THE MOST RESTRICTED ONE.
	Scenario :: we have 2 users,A,B. B has read/write access on account object via profile. Same with user A. User A shared an account record with user B using manual sharing and gave only read access.
				Can user B edit that record??
	Answer :: No,since SF prefer the most restricted security and here most restricted is read only via manual sharing.
	
	Scenario :: User B has read access at object level and user A tries to give read/write via manual sharing,can B edit the records??
	Answer :: NO same reason as above.
	
	Scenario :: We have 2 record types X-Y,User B has access to only X. Can B access the records created using recordtype Y??
	Answer :: Yes,Record types doesnot restrict user from accessing any record. It does restrict from creating a record of that record type if record type is not accesible.
	
	Scenario :: We have 2 users U1 & U2 . U1 is up in hierarchy of U2. U1 has read permission of object and U2 has read/write.Can U1 edit the records owned by U2 since U1 is up in hierarchy??
	Answer :: No, U1 doesnot have object level access to edit. And Role hierarchy just allows the visibility.
	
	Scenario :: User A has access to User B data but User B cannot see User A data ? What can be the possible reason ??
	Answer ::  OWD has to be private for the object ,
				i.then User A can be at higher position in role Hierarchy than User B and hence he can see user B data
				ii.If both are at same level in roles,then there may be a sharing rule based on criteria or owner which allows user A to see.
				iii.If no sharing rule,there can be a case where user B has manually shared the records with user A.
				iv.If even thats not the case, then there can be apex sharing which allows User A to access records. 
	
	Scenario :: User A has shared an account record with User B manually. Now if user A leaves the org or get deactivated what will happen? Can User B still access the record?
	Answer :: No, Once user get deactivated manual sharing ends. User B needs a re-share to work on that record again.
	
	Scenario :: We have a apex class mentioned with sharing and we have a nested apex class which has without sharing context, what will be the overall sharing??
	Answer :: child class does not inherit access from parent class. if parent is without,it will show all records without considering Sharing rules and if child class for the same is wwith sharing,it will cover Sharing rules.
				
LWC [LMS,Parent child]
	code for conditional rendering a list and map [https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/297834/iterate-a-javascript-map-in-lightning-web-component-template]
	why LWC over AURA
	when to use LWC when to use AURA
	Decorators
	Lifecycle hooks [when to use which hook]
	Parent to Child[types of data can be passed (primitive/non-primitive),decorator] 
	Child to Parent[custom event,kebabcase,lowercase,custom event parameters]
	LMS syntax meta file,publish,subscribe,msg channel
	Lightning Data Services [Wire [ui/recordApi ,getRecord], record form,record edit form,view form]
	why we have import statements : LWC is build on top of HTML elementwe need to implement the lightningElement,
		LWC is built on HTML and on top of that we have SF specific functionalities like LDS,the security etc in the lightningElement hence we import LightingElement
	And we extend it so that we can leverage LWC features like lifecycle hooks.
	We export the class to be used by others
	LWC-Apex Interaction [wire(immutable data.if want to mutate create shallow copy),imperative data]
	lightning component bundle [html,css,js,meta.xml]
	Can we put multiple decorators in one property.[execution engine will not decide which one to use first as all decorators have their own features]
	Can we change the value of a property in child component which was passed by parent component.[@api property can be changed in child or not??]
		- NO we get the values from parent to child in read-only format.[only way is to clone the property and change the value]
	Can we put wire inside a method?? - No [decorators should be used inside the class and not inside the method]
	When does wire property gets value ?? 
		first runs constructor -> then wire runs and get default value ->
			execution engine runs and if default values not available it assigns undefined -> when values are avaliable it loads value to wire -> connected callback
	Difference between Event.StopPropogation vs Event.PreventDefault ??
		Event.PreventDefault :: Stops the default behaviour of form
		Event.StopPropogation :: stops propogating nested events [if we have events on div inside div inside div and the innermost div gets clicked but you dont want other div's event to be fired then use StopPropogation]
		CALLBACK FUNCTION :: if a fuinction is input parameter for another function [Callback functions are not sync or async. Behaviour depends on the function in which we are calling the function]
	Promise and PromiseAll ::
	SHADOW DOM :: Inner DOM within a DOM 
	Can we use LWC in Flows - In screen flow yes,in RTF no
	
Trigger scenarios [Order of execution]
	- prevent contact duplicates based on email,
	- custom rollup summary,
	- max-min amount of opportunity on account,
	- Creation of task on creation of opportunity and send email when task is not completed on due date,
	- Account should have only one primary contact [selected from linked contacts using a custom checkbox] if one selected other should get un-selected.

Why should we hire you [what values you bring to org ] 
	Flexible with the learnings and open to work on new technologies.
	Worked on multiple clouds and done respected certifications
	even in previous orgs took up the work as challenge when I was being asked to work and deliver
