A positive integer is defined as an integer greater than zero. Implement the method positiveIntegers that takes as input a list of integers numbers, and returns a new list with non-positive integers removed.

Example: positiveIntegers(new List {2, -3, 6, 2}) returns a list containing the numbers 2, 6, 2.
